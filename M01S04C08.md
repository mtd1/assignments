# **Enumerable Functions (M01S04C08)**

## Questions

#### 1.

>Describe a `map` method.

The `map()` function iterates through each item in an array, changes it, and returns a new array when finished. The original array remains unaltered.

---

#### 2.

>Describe a `filter` method.

The `filter()` function iterates through each item in an array, checks to see if the item returns `true` to a Boolean expression and if it returns `false` the item is removed.

---

#### 3.

>What is the difference between the `map()` and the `filter()` function?

A major difference between `map()` and `filter()` is that `filter()`, when returning a new array alters the length of the original array. `map()` does not. Another major difference is that `map()` actually alters the values in the individual items in the array, whereas `filter()` does not.

## Code

>Using the numbers provided in the editor, use `filter()` function to remove any numbers that are less than four then use `reduce()` function to sum the remaining numbers.

```js
var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8,4,3,2];
var totalOfLowNums = numbers
  .filter(item => item >= 4)
  .reduce((total, item) => total + item);
console.log(totalOfLowNums);
```
