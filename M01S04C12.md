# **Document Object Model (M01S04C12)**
## Questions

#### 1.

>What does the acronym DOM stand for and explain in your own words what it is.

DOM stands for Document Object Model. The idea is that it takes an HTML *document* and represents it as a single JavaScript *object* with all the elements nestled inside.

#### 2.

>How does the DOM make web programming more efficient?

Because it allows for programming (in our case now: JavaScript) to connect with the page (HTML). It allows programs or scripts to alter a document's style, layout, and content instead of having to create entirely new documents.

## Code

>Using `createElement` and `getElementById`. Add a new Shirt to the `ul`. Set the `innerText` equal to 'Mens T-shirt'.

#### HTML
```HTML
<h3>Shirts</h3>
<ul id='list'>
    <li>Biker Jacket</li>
</ul>
```

#### JavaScript
```js
let newLi = document.createElement('Li');
newLi.innerText = 'Mens T-shirt';
document.getElementById('list').appendChild(newLi);
```
