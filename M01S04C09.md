# **Functions (M01S04C09)**
## Questions

#### 1.

>Describe/define DRY and why functions exist.

The acronym DRY means "Don't Repeat Yourself." It is a principle that tells us to keep our code concise and efficient in terms of length. Why repeat yourself when you have the language to be expressive enough to the point that repeating isn't necessary? One of the ways we can do this is with functions. A function is a block of code that causes an action. It can be declared, called, and mutated. After being declared, functions can take a complex chunk of code and reduce it down to a single word when it needs to be repeated or called. They allow for much more concise, malleable, and efficient coding.

>Describe/define the difference between creating a function and calling/executing a function.

Creating a function is the process of defining what exactly the function is supposed to do, what, if any, parameters it will have, if it will be assigned a variable, etc. Calling a function is to cause that chunk or block of code to actually run and be executed. Creating a function is like designing a tool and how it will work; calling a function is actually attempting to use it.

>Describe/define what arguments/parameters are and how they relate to functions.

Parameters are names of variable-like inputs, called arguments, that are passed to a given function and are manipulated within the function to produce its result.

#### 4.

>Describe/define mutating (dirty) vs non-mutating (pure) functions.

Mutating functions actually change an object or data structure while non-mutating functions create a new object or data structure that has been altered in someway.

## Code

>Using the `shoppingCart` variable, create a function that takes the `shoppingCart` variable and returns the total cost of both items as the `total` variable.

```js
var shoppingCart = [20, 15];

function getTotalCost(prices){
  let total = 0;
  // code below
  total = prices[0] + prices[1];
  // code above
  return total;
}

getTotalCost(shoppingCart);
```
