#### 1.

>Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:
* What are the steps involved in making a cup of coffee?

1. Determine the amount of ground coffee and water needed to brew one cup.
2. Place coffee filter in coffee maker.
3. Measure out the amounts in Step 1 and add the ground coffee to the filter and the water to the water basin.
4. Make sure an empty pot is ready to receive brewed coffee.
5. Turn on coffee maker.
6. Wait until desired amount of coffee has been brewed, then remove pot and pour into cup.

#### 2.
>In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem?

We would work our way in reserve back through the roadmap until we reached the last step that worked correctly. We would then know that some part of the next step is what created the problem.

#### 3.

>What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?

Well we would know that the final step, "Say Hi," is not working, so we would then backtrack to the step before that: "User Button Click." If this step was working correctly, then we would know that the "Say Hi" step is where the problem is most likely to reside. If "User Button Click" was _not_ working correctly, we would go back another step to "User Name Input." If this step worked correctly, the problem is most certainly in the "User Button Click" step. And finally, if "User Name Input" was failing we would know that the error is arising out of that step because there are no previous steps.

#### 4.

>Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.

**Problem**:

I need wrinkle-free shirts for work.

**Roadmap**:
1. Check closet and pick a shirt to wear to work.
2. Determine if too wrinkled to wear.
3. If shirt is too wrinkled, go to Step 4. If not too wrinkled, wear and end process.
4. Eliminate the wrinkles.
5. Ensure shirt is wrinkle-free and if so, wear.

In the case that I progress through Step 5 and still have a wrinkled shirt, I would backtrack through the steps to find that the last working step was Step 3, which would mean Step 4 is most likely where the issue occured. For example, the step says to eliminate the wrinkles, but what if I decided within that step to use the wrinkle-release setting on my clothes dryer instead of steam-ironing my shirt? While more convenient, it is also a much less effective method. So I would then try an iron as the alternative method and more than likely my shirt would be wrinkle-free!
