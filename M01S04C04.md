# Questions

#### 1.

>What are the three types of conditional statements?

* `if`
* `else`
* `else if`

#### 2.

>What are four types of Comparison Operators and how you would use them?

* `!=` is the inequality operator. You would use it to determine if a value does not equal another.
* `===` is the strict equality operator. You would use it to determine if two values are equal _and_ share the same data type.
* `>` is the greater than operator. It would be used to determine if the value that precedes the operator is greater than the value that follows the operator.
* `<=` is the less than or equal to operator. You would use it to determine if the value preceding the operator is less than _or_ equal to the value that follows the operator.

# Code

>Create a variable called grade and set it to the grade you plan to receive on this assignment. Then write an `if` statement that will check whether the grade is equal to an A, B, C, D, F and inform the user if they passed or failed using `console.log()`

```js
let grade = 'A';
if (grade == 'F') {
  console.log('FAIL');
} else if (grade == 'D') {
  console.log('FAIL');
} else if (grade == 'C') {
  console.log('PASS')
} else if (grade == 'B') {
  console.log('PASS')
} else if (grade == 'A') {
  console.log('PASS')
} else {
  console.log('Please enter your letter grade: A, B, C, etc.')
}
```
