# Questions

#### 1.

>What are the three things you need to provide for a loop? I.e. `for(a; b; c;)`, what are a, b, and c?

* "a" is the initialization, which is where you assign your variable a starting value.
* "b" is the condition, which is a Boolean expression which JavaScript checks to be true before each run of the loop.
* "c" is the final-expression, which is code that runs after each iteration of the loop.

>Describe infinite loops and how to avoid them.

An infinite loop is created when your condition is always going to be true, thus the loop will never cease. Using a final expression that alters the variable in some way to eventually give a negative result on the condition check will prevent these infinite loops from occurring.

# Code

>Using the `shoppingCart` variable below, use a `for() loop` to iterate over the array and `console.log()` the shopping cart items name.

```js
var shoppingCart = [
  {
      id: 0,
      name: 'Mens Shirt',
      price: 20,
      size: 'Large'
  },
  {
  id: 1,
  name: 'kids shirt',
  price: 15,
  size: 'small'
}
]
for (let i = 0; i < shoppingCart.length; i++) {
  console.log(shoppingCart[i].name);
}
```
