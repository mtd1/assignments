## Questions

#### 1.

>What is the difference between `document.querySelector()` and `document.querySelectorAll()`?

`document.querySelector()` returns the *first* match it finds while `document.querySelectorAll()` returns an array of *all* the matches it finds.

>What is the difference between `getElement(s)By` and `querySelector(All)`?

Most of the time, browsers will process `getElement(s)By` queries faster than with `querySelector(All)`. But in some instances, such when you need to query for more than one type of element (say a certain HTML tag *and* a certain class), `querySelector(All)` maybe the more efficient of the two.

>What do JavaScript event handlers do and what is an example of one?

JavaScript event handlers execute certain code when a certain event is triggered. For example, when a user completes a form and clicks the "submit" button on your page, you may want to use an event listener to deal with the saving of the form information or load a new page for the user.

# Code

>Using the code from the prior checkpoint, add an Event Handler to the `<li>` element and `console.log()` the name of the shirt they selected.

#### HTML
```HTML
<h3>Shirts</h3>
<ul id='list'>
    <li>Biker Jacket</li>
    <li>Mens Shirt</li>
</ul>
```

#### JavaScript
```js
var shirtList = document.getElementsByTagName('li');

var listLength = shirtList.length;

function processClick() {
  console.log(this.innerText);
}

for (let i = 0; i < shirtList.length; i++){

  shirtList[i].onclick = () => {
    console.log(shirtList[i].innerText);
  }
  }
```
