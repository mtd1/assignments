#### Questions

>Why would you want to version control your code?

A: Version control is important because it helps you track code and project development. By tracking development a developer and easily see what changes and additions other team members have made. This increases communication and productivity. Version control also allows you to easily revert the code back to previous state which maybe required in the case of major software bugs.

>Where can you find additional information about the Git commands available?

A: An excellent reference source I've found is [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/docs). The website is run by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, the authors of the acclaimed book _Pro Git_. In addition to the reference section of their site, they also have their entire book available for free. Another useful site is [GitHub's official help site](https://help.github.com/).

>Why are branches useful?

A: Branches make it easier to work on new features of your site or software without affecting the main line. They allow for experimentation that is both easily merged with the master branch or, if it's useless, be disposed of. Branches create a much more flexible workflow.  

>What is the purpose of a remote?

A: Remote repositories are used to share and exchange code and code changes from one developer to another outside the local system.

>Why is it important to track changes to the upstream repository after you create your initial fork?

A: There is a chance that since the time you forked another person may have forked as well and edited the same line of the same file that you did. Without knowing that by tracking the changes to the upstream repository, you will get an unexpected merge conflict error when attempting to merge your branch with the other's.
